SIS - Simple Instruction Simulator README file
----------------------------------------------

SIS uses the GNU autoconf system, and can simply be build using:

	./configure 

followed by 

	make

To build a PDF version of the manual, do

	make sis.pdf.


To enable emulation of an L1 cache, run configure with --enable-l1cache. This option
only improves timing accuracy, it does not affect simulation behaviour.
